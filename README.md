# Real-Time-Django-Chat
This is a project I did to test out Django web sockets in 3.10.4.

# Steps to run
Create and run a new environment in Python 3.10.4 using the requirements.txt
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py makemigrations" This will check and optimize the tables
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py migration" This will implement those tables
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py runserver" This will run the server on port 8000

# Website
The website has an intuitive login/signup system, so follow the steps provided.
If you wish to test out the websocket chat room, make another account in another browser, create and join a room

# Credit
This was the tutorial followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1k_Twr9cg&t=730s (The project was properly annotated and differs from the tutorial at certain points)

# Warning
This code is not production-ready, several comments were autogenerated from Django explaining what needs to be changed. It is also recommended to use a different type of database which can be changed in the settings. Also there is a setting in known-hosts that needs to be reconfigured.
