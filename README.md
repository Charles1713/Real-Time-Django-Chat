# Real-Time-Django-Chat
This is a project I did to test out Django web sockets in 3.10.4.

# Steps to run
Create and run a new environment in Python 3.10.4 using the requirements.txt
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py makemigrations" This will check and optimize the tables
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py migration" This will implement those tables
Run the following command "<Folder Directory>/djangochat/manage.py runserver" This will run the server on port 8000

# Website
The website has an intuitive login/signup system, so follow the steps provided.
If you wish to test out the websocket chat room, make another account in another browser, create and join a room
